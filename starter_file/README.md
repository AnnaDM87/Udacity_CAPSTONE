*NOTE:* This file is a template that you can use to create the README for your project. The *TODO* comments below will highlight the information you should be sure to include.

# Your Project Title Here

*TODO:* Write a short introduction to your project.

## Project Set Up and Installation
*OPTIONAL:* If your project has any special installation steps, this is where you should put it. To turn this project into a professional portfolio project, you are encouraged to explain how to set up this project in AzureML.

## Dataset

### Overview
I used the Employee dataset provided by kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tawfikelmetwally/employee-dataset
The Dataset dataset contains information about employees in a company, including their educational backgrounds, work history, demographics, and employment-related factors. It has been anonymized to protect privacy while still providing valuable insights into the workforce.

#### Columns:

Education: The educational qualifications of employees, including degree, institution, and field of study.

Joining Year: The year each employee joined the company, indicating their length of service.

City: The location or city where each employee is based or works.

Payment Tier: Categorization of employees into different salary tiers.

Age: The age of each employee, providing demographic insights.

Gender: Gender identity of employees, promoting diversity analysis.

Ever Benched: Indicates if an employee has ever been temporarily without assigned work.

Experience in Current Domain: The number of years of experience employees have in their current field.

Leave or Not: a target column

### Task
*TODO*: Explain the task you are going to be solving with this dataset and the features you will be using for it.

### Access
*TODO*: Explain how you are accessing the data in your workspace.

## Automated ML
*TODO*: Give an overview of the `automl` settings and configuration you used for this experiment

### Results
*TODO*: What are the results you got with your automated ML model? What were the parameters of the model? How could you have improved it?

*TODO* Remeber to provide screenshots of the `RunDetails` widget as well as a screenshot of the best model trained with it's parameters.

## Hyperparameter Tuning
*TODO*: What kind of model did you choose for this experiment and why? Give an overview of the types of parameters and their ranges used for the hyperparameter search


### Results
*TODO*: What are the results you got with your model? What were the parameters of the model? How could you have improved it?

*TODO* Remeber to provide screenshots of the `RunDetails` widget as well as a screenshot of the best model trained with it's parameters.

## Model Deployment
*TODO*: Give an overview of the deployed model and instructions on how to query the endpoint with a sample input.

## Screen Recording
*TODO* Provide a link to a screen recording of the project in action. Remember that the screencast should demonstrate:
- A working model
- Demo of the deployed  model
- Demo of a sample request sent to the endpoint and its response

## Standout Suggestions
*TODO (Optional):* This is where you can provide information about any standout suggestions that you have attempted.
